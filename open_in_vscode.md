Sure, here's a Bash script that will open the current directory in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) when you right-click in your file manager:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Visual Studio Code is installed
if ! command -v code &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Visual Studio Code is not installed. Please install it first."
    exit 1
fi

# Get the current directory
current_dir="$(pwd)"

# Open the current directory in Visual Studio Code
code "$current_dir"
```

Here's how it works:

1. The script starts with the shebang line `#!/bin/bash` to specify that it should be run with the Bash shell.

2. It checks if the `code` command (which is used to launch Visual Studio Code) is available on the system. If it's not found, it prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status code.

3. It gets the current working directory using the `pwd` command and stores it in the `current_dir` variable.

4. Finally, it launches Visual Studio Code and opens the current directory using the `code` command, passing the `current_dir` variable as an argument.

To use this script, save it to a file with a `.sh` extension, for example, `openFolderVscode.sh`. Then, make the script executable with the following command:

```
chmod +x openFolderVscode.sh
```

Next, you'll need to set up a way to run this script when you right-click in your file manager. The exact steps depend on your desktop environment and file manager, but here's a general idea:

1. Open your file manager preferences or settings.
2. Look for an option to add custom actions or scripts for right-click menus.
3. Create a new action or script entry, and configure it to run your `openFolderVscode.sh` script when you right-click on a folder.
4. **for Xubunut go  " file manager > edit > configure custom actions "**

   
After setting it up correctly, when you right-click on a folder in your file manager, you should see a new option (e.g., "Open in VSCode") that will launch Visual Studio Code and open the selected folder.

Note that this script assumes that you have Visual Studio Code installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you'll need to do that first before running the script.
