Certainly! To copy and rename folders in Linux, you can use the `cp` and `mv` commands. Here's how to do it:

Copying a folder:
1. `cp`: The `cp` command with the `-r` option is used to recursively copy directories and their contents.
   - Syntax: `cp -r [options] source_directory destination_directory`
   - Example: `cp -r folder1 folder2` creates a copy of "folder1" named "folder2" with all its contents.

Renaming a folder:
1. `mv`: The `mv` command is used to move files and directories, and it can also be used to rename directories.
   - Syntax: `mv [options] source_directory new_directory_name`
   - Example: `mv folder1 new_folder` renames "folder1" to "new_folder".

Please note that when using `cp -r` or `mv` with directories, you need to include the `-r` option to indicate that the operation should be performed recursively. This ensures that the entire directory structure and its contents are copied or moved.

Additionally, make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform the desired actions. Some directories may require administrative privileges to copy or rename.
