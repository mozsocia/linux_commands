Certainly! Here are the commands to copy and rename files in Linux:

1. Copying a file:
   - `cp`: The `cp` command is used to copy files and directories.
   - Syntax: `cp [options] source_file destination_file`
   - Example: `cp file.txt file_copy.txt` creates a copy of "file.txt" named "file_copy.txt".

2. Renaming a file:
   - `mv`: The `mv` command is used to move files and directories, but it can also be used to rename files.
   - Syntax: `mv [options] source_file new_file_name`
   - Example: `mv file.txt new_file.txt` renames "file.txt" to "new_file.txt".

Please note that both `cp` and `mv` can also be used with directory paths instead of file names. When specifying file paths, you can use relative paths (e.g., `./file.txt` for the current directory) or absolute paths (e.g., `/home/user/file.txt` for the file located at "/home/user/").
